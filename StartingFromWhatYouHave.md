The system's purpose is to provide a platform that will make medical consultations more convenient for both patients and doctors. Furthermore, our system is designed to make ordering drugs from pharmacies as simple as possible. It will also include tools to improve and track delivery services. in addition, the system will make it easier for doctors to diagnose and will serve all types of patients, including those who are unable to write or who have hearing issues. Maintaining a single system takes less time and effort than maintaining many systems, which saves money for the institution and time for system maintainers.
The Hayat project documentation is available. The file "srs.pdf" will assist open-source developers in checking out the details they need to make an informed decision about whether to join the development team. Because the project is so large, the open-source developer may search for a specific section that suits his skills and may have excellent ideas to contribute to the Hayat project. If a developer has prior experience constructing library systems, he can request that the sections in Hayat relating to library components be developed.

Mission statement: Allow people to use one single powerful system with great capabilities, by combining multiple systems into a single system.
