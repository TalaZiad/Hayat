Choosing a decent name for the project is one of the most critical aspects of running a successful free software project. It is critical to choose a good name that expresses the project's principal idea. The name should be distinct from the names of other projects.
For our project, we took a few measures to ensure that we choose a suitable name that adhered to the recommendations for selecting a decent name for an open-source project.
firstly, we used a variety of websites that offer project name suggestions, like business name generators and namesnack website. In the website's checked box, we included the keyword "Online Medical Consultation and Pharmacy Management System." Then, for our project, both sites generated a significant number of prospective names for us to choose from. but the name was decided based on the application name used for the 305 project.
The next stage was to hold a vote among the team members to get a final decision on the name. As a result, all of the team members agreed on the name "Hayat" for our project, because it embodies the fundamental idea of our project, which is to make medical consultations and treatment from pharmacies available online, making patients' lives easier.
The system planned to be developed through this project is a free and open-source system that is built to facilitate ordering medicines from pharmacies. It will also include features to improve and track delivery services. 
The system is intended to decrease the mortality rate amongst the citizens of Bahrain by providing a platform that will facilitate ease of medical consultation. Moreover, our system is also built to facilitate ordering medicines from pharmacies. It will also include features to improve and track delivery services. 

There are some limitations that can be listed as follows:

1-The system will be implemented by high-level languages and supports Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP only.

2-•The software should be accessed by pharmacies (to supply medicines), doctors, and patients (for online medical consultation and buying medicines).

3-•Doctor’s profile will be automatically deleted when the doctor retires.

4-The project will be completed after 3 months from the start date, with no exceptions. the system’s lifespan can last up to10 years if maintained and updated regularly.
