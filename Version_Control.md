The GitHub was chosen because it provides infinite free hosting for our open-source project. 
In addition, we store all project sources that may be altered under version control, such as design documents, figures, requirement management plans, and so on. 
This technique will make it easier to make modifications to the documents by just submitting a commit. 
Developers must keep track of changes to files over time to remember particular versions afterwards. 
As a result, we must implement a version control system to restore chosen files to their prior condition. 
Developers want to compare changes over time and discover which files were last edited and may be causing an issue. 
We also want to track our work for that we will be using issues which will provide us with:

1) Timeline of our progress.
2) Track our work.
3) Keep us updated on the most recent comments.
4) Help with making the communication efficient where we can just @mention.
5) Comparing and pinning important issues.
