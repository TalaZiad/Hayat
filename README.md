# Hayat

Since the world is currently going through a stage of pandemic COVD-19, new and innovative ways of healthcare solutions must be introduced. This project addresses an opportunity to provide a tool which supports both patients and Medical practitioners in the evolution of healthcare experience with the goal to optimize the overall health and wellness. The goal of this project is to provide both the patients and medical practitioners a platform which will facilitate ease of medical consultation. Moreover, our system is also built to facilitate ordering medicines from pharmacy. It will also include features to improve and track delivery services.



The project title is Hayat. It is proposed using two ideas.

• Online Medical Consultation

• Online Pharmacy Services

The system is designed to provide and easy and efficient way of communication and consultation between the patients and medical practitioners in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
Due to the current situation of pandemic, people are advised not to visit medical departments much. This situation have made it difficult for the people to have medical consultations and people due to fear aren’t visiting certain medical departments.
the system can be helpful to some extent even in the recent pandemic of COVID-19, where doctors can consult the patients online. This can be a very helpful and innovative solution depending on world todays situation.
