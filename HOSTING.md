## Hosting 
We  Have hosted our project by using canned hosting sites. 
We have chosen to host it on github  AS GH provides a lot of hosting services as revision control system RCS (aka version control system), bug/issue tracker, and the wiki And it is a free software which meet our Budget scope. The GitHub was chosen because it provides infinite free hosting for our open-source project. In addition, we store all project sources that may be altered under version control, such as design documents, figures, requirement management plans, and so on. This technique will make it easier to make modifications to the documents by just submitting a commit. Developers must keep track of changes to files over time to remember particular versions afterwards

We have chosen gitlab and sourceforge (sourceforge support all version control systems svn, cvs, git, and others) is another candidate if something has been broken in GH or we need to switch to another canned hosting site.
