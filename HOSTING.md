## Hosting 
We  Have hosted our project by using canned hosting sites. 
We have chosen to host it on github  AS GH provides a lot of hosting services as revision control system RCS (aka version control system), bug/issue tracker, and the wiki And it is a free software which meet our Budget scope. 

We have chosen gitlab and sourceforge (sourceforge support all version control systems svn, cvs, git, and others) is another candidate if something has been broken in GH or we need to switch to another canned hosting site.
